# :simple-dask: Model Textures (Granite)

Most model textures are located inside the `granite` folder as `.gtp` files. These textures are generated by the [Granite SDK](https://unity.com/products/granite-sdk) which GBFR uses for texture streaming.

Texture Folders:

* 4k Textures: `granite/4k/`
* 2k Textures: `granite/2k/`

!!! note

    You should be going through all three folders to extract all texture contents, but if you only need specific content; each GTS subfolder represents *mostly* a different kind of content:

    * `/0/0.gts` - World Textures, Some Effects, Some Weapons
    * `/1/1.gts` - NPC/Character & Faces, Effects
    * `/2/2.gts` - Eye/Iris

    For any content added in updates, tile sets are separated by packs of three based on version minor, so v1.1 = `3,4,5`, v1.2 = `6,7,8` and so on.

In order to extract and convert the textures, grab [GraniteTextureReader](https://github.com/Nenkai/GraniteTextureReader/releases).

If you want to extract textures, open the Command Prompt and run the following command:

``` markdown title="Command"
"../GraniteTextureReader.exe" extract-all -t <path to gts> -l <layer number>
```

!!! warning

    `-l` is an **L** as in **Lima**, not an i/1.

* Replace `<path to gts>` with the actual path to the `.gts` file
* Replace `<layer number>` with a layer number. The layer number is the type of content that you want to extract, such as:
    * `-1` - All layers, **use this by default to extract everything**.
    * `0` - Albedo, regular model textures
    * `1` - Normal maps
    * `2` or `3` - RGB maps

# :material-texture: UI Textures

Most UI (& other) textures are contained within `.wtb` files - a carry-over from Platinum Games's texture format.

1. Download [Nier CLI](https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/nier_cli/releases/tag/v1.3.0_mgrr). This program is used to convert `.wtb` texture files to a standard viewable image format, and back to into `.wtb`.
2. To extract textures, simply drop any `.wtb` file into the executable. A folder will be created.
