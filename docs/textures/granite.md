# :simple-dask: Granite Textures

Most of the model textures are located inside the `granite` folder. These textures are generated by the [Granite SDK](https://unity.com/products/granite-sdk) which GBFR uses.

In order to extract them, grab [GraniteTextureReader](https://github.com/Nenkai/GraniteTextureReader).

* 4k Textures: `granite/4k`
* 2k Textures: `granite/2k`

If you want to extract textures, run the following command:

``` markdown title="Command"
GraniteTextureReader.exe extract-all -t <path to gts> -l <layer number>
```

* Replace `<path to gts>` with the actual path to the `.gts` file
* Replace `<layer number>` with a layer number. The layer number is the type of content that you want to extract, such as:
    * `-1` - All layers, **use this by default to extract everything**.
    * `0` - Albedo, regular model textures
    * `1` - Normal maps
    * `2/3` - RGB maps

!!! note

    You should be going through all three folders to extract all texture contents, but if you only need specific content; each GTS subfolder represents *mostly* a different kind of content:

    * `0/0.gts` - World Textures, Some Effects, Some Weapons
    * `1/1.gts` - NPC/Character & Faces, Effects
    * `2/2.gts` - Eye/Iris
