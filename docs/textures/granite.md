# :simple-dask: Granite Textures

Most of the model textures are located inside the `granite` folder. These textures are generated by the [Granite SDK](https://unity.com/products/granite-sdk) which GBFR uses.

In order to extract them, grab [GraniteTextureReader](https://github.com/Nenkai/GraniteTextureReader).

* 4k Textures: `granite/4k`
* 2k Textures: `granite/2k`

If you want to extract textures, run the following command:

``` markdown title="Command"
GraniteTextureReader.exe extract-all -t <path to gts> -l <layer number>
```

* Replace `<path to gts>` with the actual path to the `.gts` file
* Replace `-l` with a layer number. The layer number is the type of content that you want to extract, such as:
    * `-1` - All layers, **use this by default to extract everything**.
    * `0` - Albedo, regular model textures
    * `1` - Normal maps
    * `2/3` - RGB maps

!!! warning
    
    * :material-arrow-right: Make sure to go through all 3 numbered folders.
