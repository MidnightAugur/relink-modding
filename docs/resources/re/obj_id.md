Object IDs are actual IDs of any object in the game. This also applies to PlatinumGames games. 

They are categorized as such:

```
0x1xxxx - pl
0x2xxxx - em
0x3xxxx - wp
0x4xxxx - et
0x5xxxx - ef
0x7xxxx - it
0x9xxxx - sc
0xCxxxx - bg
0xExxxx - bh
0xFxxxx - ba
0x100xxxx - fp
0x101xxxx - fe
0x102xxxx - fn
0x103xxxx - we
0x104xxxx - wn
0x10Axxxx - np
0x10Bxxxx - tr
0x10Cxxxx - bt
```

Where the last `xxxx` is the actual ID for every category.

!!! tip
    These IDs can be seen inside `objread` files.
