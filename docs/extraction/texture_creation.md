# :material-texture: Creating Textures

1. Download [Nier CLI](https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/nier_cli/releases/tag/v1.3.0_mgrr). This program is used to convert `.wtb` texture files to a standard viewable image format, or into `.wtb`.
2. Create a new folder named `<YOUR_FILE_NAME>.wtb_extracted`. `<YOUR_FILE_NAME>` should be replaced with the output texture file name you want. The `.wtb_extracted` at the end of the folder is important.
3. Create and/or add one or multiple `.dds` files to the folder.
4. Drag the folder into the `Nier CLI` executable. **This will overwrite any `.wtb` file if any already exists with the same name.**
